1. Run `./run-init-server.sh` in one terminal and then run `./run-init-client.sh` on another terminal after the server is ready to receive requests.
2. Remember to export the configs for syscall_intercept repository. 
3. Run `scripts/run-server.sh` in one terminal and `scripts/run-client.sh`. The client script has a sleep of 10 so this will ensure that it sends requests to the server only when it is up.
